    <p class="p1">F A Q</p>
        <p class="p2">Q : What's the forecast for Bali's weather?</p>        
        <p class="p3">A : Bali typically experiences hot, sunny, and humid weather, with the rainy season lasting from November to February or March. During this time, rain showers are common in the afternoon or at night, but the rest of the day remains warm and sunny, with temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The nights are cooler.</p>
        <p class="p4">Q : Is Bali considered a safe destination?</p>
        <p class="p5">A : Bali, known for its serene atmosphere and Hindu heritage, faced security challenges in 2002 and 2005 from external threats. Since then, Indonesian authorities have ramped up monitoring and preventive measures to counter terrorism. While street safety, especially in places like Ubud, is generally good, travelers should be cautious of petty theft in beach areas. Securing belongings on motorbikes, especially at night, is recommended</p>   
        <p class="p6">Q : What's the typical cost of food in Bali?</p>
        <p class="p7">A : You can expect to pay significantly less for local Indonesian dishes like Nasi Campur and Babi Guling, typically around IDR 30,000 (USD $2.50) per meal. Dining at a mid-range restaurant will usually range from IDR 100,000 to 250,000 ($12-20), while fine dining establishments may charge anywhere from IDR 500,000 to over 1,000,000+ ($40-$80).</p>
